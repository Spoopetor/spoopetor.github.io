        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <br>
        <h2>My Background:</h2>
        <p style="margin-left: 30px;">I'm a Computer Science Master's Student and this is my first semester here at UAlbany.
        For my undergraduate studies, I attended RIT where I had a concentration in Artificial Intelligence and Computer Vision/Graphics.
        I was originally a Mechanical Engineering major for a year and a half before realizing I liked programming much more than engineering.
        RIT requires all students to complete a co-op internship as a part of the degree, so I spent a year working for a government lab processing weather data.
        I grew up here in Albany and came back home after finishing my undergraduate degree. I have 2 cats named Finley and Dakota as well as a dog named Taffy.
        </p>

        <h2>My Interests:</h2>
        <ul>
        <li>In my free time I still enjoy engineering, particularly robotics.</li>
        <li>I'm a big fan of <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/racing/2025">Formula 1</a> and my favorite team is Red Bull Racing; I'm currently hoping they somehow reclaim the lead in the championship.</li>
        <li>As for video games, I'm currently playing Minecraft and Silksong. I used to play Siege but my friends and I have kind of drifted away from the game recently.</li>
        <li>I like to build computers for myself and friends as well as working on my 3D printers.</li>
        </ul>
